# PyOCR

One of the oldest and most studied topics in [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) is Optical Character Recognition. This project aims to recreate some of this history with a dataset taken from [Kaggle's Julia competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/street-view-getting-started-with-julia/data). The workflow for the project is:

1. Initial research with raw pixel data on the basic image set
2. Modifications in approach (pixel value flattening, change in input dimensions, feature selection, label modification)
3. Expansion of project scope (detect characters/words in real images)
4. Combination of previous parts for a working product that can accurately label and detect characters

Please see my iPython notebook for a detailed view of my work so far. A complete system with better UI will follow.
